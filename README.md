#Overview
AgriChain is a tool that helps with everything in farming, from growing crops to selling them. It makes sure everything works well, tracks where food comes from, and keeps food quality high until itâ€™s sold. Farming has many steps because agriculture products are perishable in nature. AgriChain manages all these parts in one place. With AgriChain, farmers can keep track of their harvests and inventory. AgriChain efficiently manages operations across 250 farms, overseeing the production processing, sales orders, and deliveries of 30,000 food items weekly to ensure their top quality. Additionally, it facilitates the monthly sale of crops worth $1.5 million, contributing to a more efficient and sustainable agricultural process for all stakeholders.  AgriChain provides a centralized platform to manage procurement, production, distribution, and sales processes efficiently. This system will empower farmers, distributors, retailers, and customers with transparency, accountability, and sustainability throughout the agricultural supply chain.
